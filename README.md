# MetaBorg development environment

This repository contains a Gradle script to manage a development environment for MetaBorg projects.
The script supports cloning and updating Git repositories that contain the source code for MetaBorg projects, building (compiling and testing) these projects, and publishing of their artifacts.

## Requirements

To run Gradle, a Java Development Kit (JDK) of version 8 or higher is needed.
Gradle does not need to be installed, as this repository includes a Gradle wrapper script which automatically downloads Gradle.

## Updating repositories

To update repositories to their latest version, and to clone new repositories, run:

```bash
gradlew updateRepos
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat` instead.

## Building

To build all projects in all repositories, run:

```bash
gradlew buildAll
```

## Gradle tasks

Gradle can execute tasks besides just building. Run:

```
gradlew tasks
```
to get an overview of which tasks can be executed. Interesting tasks will be in these categories:

* 'Composite build tasks': tasks that will be executed on every project, such as:
* 'Application tasks': tasks that will build and run applications.
* 'Devenv tasks': tasks for managing this development environment, such as:

## Importing into IntelliJ IDEA

Import the project as a Gradle project. See [Importing a project from a Gradle model](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import).

When new repositories are cloned, refresh all Gradle projects. See [Refreshing a linked Gradle project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_refresh_project).

To run Gradle tasks inside IntelliJ, see [Working with Gradle tasks](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_tasks).
Gradle tasks can be executed in Debug mode, which also enables debugging of any VMs that Gradle starts, such as those for running an application or testing, enabling debugging of applications and tests.

## Importing into Eclipse

Eclipse supports Gradle through the [buildship](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship) plugin, which should be installed into Eclipse by default.
However, using Eclipse is discouraged, as IntelliJ has much better support for Gradle.

Import the project as an existing Gradle project. See [Import an existing Gradle project](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html#import-an-existing-gradle-project).

When new repositories are cloned, refresh the `devenv` Gradle project. See [Refresh Gradle Project](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html#updating-classpath-with-the-latest-changes-in-the-build-file).

Running tasks of a composite build in Eclipse is currently not supported.

## Modifying repositories

By default, no repositories will be cloned or updated, they must be explicitly included.
List all available repositories and their properties with:

```
gradlew listRepos
```

Each repository has the following properties:
* `name`: name of the repository, defined in `build.gradle.kts`.
* `update`: each repository for which `update` is `true` will be cloned or updated when running `gradlew updateRepos`.
* `branch`: repository will be checked out to the corresponding `branch`, which defaults to the current branch of this repository.
* `path`: repository will be cloned into the corresponding `path`, which defaults to the `name`. Changing this property will cause a new repository to be cloned, while the old repository is left untouched (in case you have made changes to it), which may cause conflicts. In that case, push your changes and delete the old repository.
* `url`: The remote `url` will be used for cloning and pulling, which defaults to `<repoUrlPrefix>/<name>.git` where the `repoUrlPrefix` is set in `build.gradle.kts`.

To enable `update` for a repository, create or open the `repo.properties` file, and add a `<name>=true` line to it. For example:

```properties
spoofax.eclipse=true
```

The `branch`, `path`, and `url` properties can be overridden in `repo.properties` by appending the name of the property to the key, for example:

```properties
spoofax.eclipse.branch=develop
spoofax.eclipse.path=spoofax-eclipse
spoofax.eclipse.url=https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax.eclipse.git
```

## Adding repositories

To add a new repository, add a `registerRepo` call to the first `devenv` block in `build.gradle.kts`.
The first argument is the name of the repository, which must be unique.
Default values for `update`, `branch`, `path`, and `url` can be given as optional arguments.

## Adding new Gradle tasks

In the first `tasks` block in `build.gradle.kts`, `register` a new task that depends on a task in an included build that does what you want.

## Shared and personal development environments

To create a shared development environment, create a new branch of this repository and set up the `repo.properties` file to update the corresponding repositories, and push the branch.

To create a personal development environment, fork this repository and set up the `repo.properties` file in your fork.

In both cases, pull in changes from `master` of `origin` to receive updates to the build script and list of repositories.

## Behind the scenes

This project uses the [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) for build scripts, so that we can write `settings.gradle.kts` and `build.gradle.kts` in Kotlin, to get more type checking and editor services.

We use a Gradle feature called [Composite Builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html), which allow multiple Gradle builds to be easily composed together.
We include all subdirectories (which are usually repositories) in the composite build, achieved in the last code block in `settings.gradle.kts`.

The repository update functionality comes from the `org.metaborg.gradle.config.devenv` plugin which is applied at the top of `build.gradle.kts`.
This plugin exposes the `devenv` extension which allows configuration of repositories.
